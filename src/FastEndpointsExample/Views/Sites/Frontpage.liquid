  <p class="text-xl leading-10 mb-4">
    Datastar is a lightweight hypermedia framework that brings reactive functionality to server-rendered applications.
    It combines the best of both worlds:

    <li>The simplicity and reliability of server-side rendering</li>
    <li>
      The dynamic, reactive user experience in the style of a Single Page Application (SPA) but with very little to no

    While looking into dotnet and Datastar, I found that there were very few examples of using Datastar with FastEndpoints. So I decided to take a run at it.
    During the process I stumbled across a few useful repositories from other authors taking a run at implementing Datastar with dotnet in different UI frameworks.

    Base for my repo is from his "DatastarExamples" repository. It is a collection of examples of using Datastar with different frameworks and languages.
    The examples are not all working, but they are a good starting point for learning how to use Datastar with different frameworks.
