# Datastar and FastEndpoints example

## What is Datastar?

Datastar is a lightweight hypermedia framework that brings reactive functionality to server-rendered applications. It combines the best of both worlds:

 - The simplicity and reliability of server-side rendering
 - The dynamic, reactive user experience in the style of a Single Page Application (SPA) but with very little to no JavaScript

 ## Goals

 - [x] .NET 9 API with hot-reload
